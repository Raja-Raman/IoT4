NOTE:
If you get the following error message while uploading code to Arduino:
"Expected signature 0x1e 0x95 0x0F,  but found 0x1e 0x95 0x14" :

Explanation:
The standard Arduino boards bought from the market have a signature 0x1e 0x95 0x0F
built into the ATmega chip.

But if you are building your own version of Arduino board from scratch, the ATMega
chip may have the signature 0x1e 0x95 0x14. This prevents code from being uploaded.

Solution:

Edit the configuration file avrdude.conf. It will be usually in the folder
C:\Program Files\Arduino\hardware\tools\avr\etc\avrdude.conf

(Tip: Make a backup copy of the file before modifying)

Search for the string  0x1e 0x95 0x0F.

You will see a line like:
signature		= 0x1e 0x95 0x0F
Comment out that line.

Add the following line:
signature		= 0x1e 0x95 0x14

The resulting section will look like this:

    # modified by Rajaraman to work with customized board
    #signature		= 0x1e 0x95 0x0F;
    signature		= 0x1e 0x95 0x14;    
    # end modified by Rajaraman
    
Save the file.

Restart Arduino IDE.

Done !
